## Bank-Loan-Decision

Loan sanctioning and credit scoring forms a multi-billion dollar industry -- in the US alone. With everyone from young students, entrepreneurs, and multi-million dollar companies turning to banks to seek financial support for their ventures, processing these applications creates a complex and cumbersome task for any banking institution. As of 2022, more than 20 million people in the US have active loans owing a collective debt of 178 billion dollars. Despite that, more than 20% of all applicants were denied loans. The loan approval or rejection has enormous ramifications for both the applicant and the bank, causing possible opportunity costs for both parties.
